# Club Member Maven project
This is a final project for the Server (backend) Programming course.

The project was built using Spring boot maven. I used Java as the main language and used eclipse to develop the project.

## About the project
The project is for a sports club admin. The admin can add players and create new match. The admin can then add players to each match. The players can log in using their credentials and check for which games they are assigned to.
